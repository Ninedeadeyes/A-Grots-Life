# A-Grots-Life (Advance) 

A Survival / Crafting Game written using Tkinter and OOPS. 

Key features

-Crafting/Survival Mechanics 

-TKINTER GUI 

-Fetch quest generator 

-Hidden Gambling Den 

-Multiple Endings 


-All graphics created using GraphicsGale

This is a Tkinter version of 'A Grots life' in my mini-game series with added crafting items and mechanics/features. 

Had to change some of the code before converting to EXE file  (instead of quit() had to use sys.exit) hence why there are two python files
(A grots life (Advance) is the original) 


-To play without python download all files and run the exe file.
