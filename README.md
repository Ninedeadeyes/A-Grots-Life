# A-Grots-Life

A Survival Game written in standard library where you play as a grot doing what a grot do.  

Simple (A) version is a good step to learning OOP (object oriented programming) whilst (B) version is the completely implemented. 

Version B is a good easy example of OOP programming since you are only using 3 files.  

After much work on Version (C) and having added so many different elements and features it really deserve to be called its own 
seperate game.  A Grots Life 2, using Tkinter and adds many more different features from the original. Still in progress but the 
Alpha build is very much playable.
