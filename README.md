# A-Grots-Life

A Survivial Game written in standard library where you play as a grot doing what a grot do. 

Will be making a simple version to learn OOP ( As there is only 3 modules this would be a good example of Object-oriented programming  ) 

Will also be making a advance version with graphics using pygame. 

Both versions are work in progress.
