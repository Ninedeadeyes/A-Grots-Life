# A-Grots-Life

A Survival Game written in standard library where you play as a grot doing what a grot do.  

Simple (A) version is a good step to learning OOP whilst (B) version it is completely implemented. 

Version B is a good easy example of OOP programming since you are only using 3 files.  

Might still be making a version (C) with advance graphics. Work in progress.
